## Prerequisites

Before using this application, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python:**
    - This project requires **Python 3.8 >= 3.11.** Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    - You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
&nbsp;
2. **OpenAI API Key:**
   - To access certain features and functionalities, you'll need a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
   - If you don't have an API key, you can obtain one by following the instructions on the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
&nbsp;
3. **LangChain:**
    - LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models. As a language model integration framework, LangChain's use cases include document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis. Learn about [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/).
&nbsp;
4. **Streamlit:**
    - Streamlit is a free and open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps. It is a Python-based library specifically designed for machine learning engineers. Learn about [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). [Installation requirements](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation)
&nbsp;
5. **Streamlit-Option-Menu:**
    - streamlit-option-menu is a simple Streamlit component that allows users to select a single item from a list of options in a menu. It is similar in function to st.selectbox(), except that: It uses a simple static list to display the options instead of a dropdown. Learn about [Streamlit-Option-Menu](https://github.com/victoryhb/streamlit-option-menu).
